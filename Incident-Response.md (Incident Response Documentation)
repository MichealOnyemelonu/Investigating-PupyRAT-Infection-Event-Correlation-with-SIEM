# Incident Response Plan: PupyRAT Detection

## Step 1: Detection
- PupyRAT infection detected via SIEM alerts (triggered by correlation rules).
- Immediate action: Notify the security team and initiate incident response.

## Step 2: Containment
- Isolate the infected machine from the network.
- Disable any suspicious processes (e.g., PowerShell or reverse shell activity).
- Block known malicious IP addresses (C2 servers) at the firewall.

## Step 3: Eradication
- Remove all PupyRAT-related files from the infected system.
- Reimage the machine to ensure no malware remnants remain.
- Patch any vulnerabilities that may have led to the infection.

## Step 4: Recovery
- Restore the machine from a clean backup.
- Monitor network traffic for signs of re-infection or lateral movement.

## Step 5: Lessons Learned
- Conduct a post-incident analysis.
- Update SIEM rules to improve detection for future infections.
- Provide training to employees on phishing and other infection vectors.
